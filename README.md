# Ron Swanson Quotes

This is a fun react on rails application 
which displays quotes from Ron Swanson of
Parks and Recreation.

###To install this application:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bundle && npm install` in your terminal
3. Then run `bin/rails server` and visit localhost:3000
4. Thats it, you are good to go!


I enjoyed this project beacause it was my first combining React and Rails and it is just a simple application that can bring someone a little joy.
